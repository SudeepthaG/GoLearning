# GoLearning

This repository stores my learning journey with Go.

I have utilized this tutorial: https://golangbot.com/learn-golang-series/ for learning Go. 
The folders and files in this repository contains my implementations, experiments and explanations for different Topics in Go. 


You can implement different functions in different packages through the main.go file by using the command: 
go run main.go


Feel free to clone this package, comment and uncomment different parts to understand Go better.
