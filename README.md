# GoLearning

This repository stores my learning journey with Go.

I have mainly utilized this tutorial: https://golangbot.com/learn-golang-series/ for learning Go. 

The folders and files in this repository contains 
1. my implementations based on above tutorial,
2. additional experiments and 
3. explanations for special/confusing cases for different Topics in Go. 


You can implement different functions in different packages through the main.go file by using the command: 
go run main.go


Feel free to clone this package, comment and uncomment different parts to understand Go better.
